## Architecture Overview

EqTrak is organized into several key modules:

- **Portfolio**: Core portfolio, position, and transaction functionality
- **Metrics**: System for defining, calculating, and displaying metrics
- **Market Data**: Integration with market data providers
- **Performance**: Gain/loss calculations and performance tracking
- **User Metrics**: Custom user-defined metric creation and management

For more details on the architecture, see [Architecture.md](Documentation/Architecture.md).

## Recent Improvements (v0.2.0)

The latest version includes important fixes to the Performance module:

- **UUID Storage**: Fixed performance metric storage by changing `object_id` from `PositiveIntegerField` to `CharField(max_length=40)` to properly handle UUID primary keys
- **Primary Key References**: Corrected references in calculation services from `.id` to model-specific primary key fields (`portfolio_id`, `position_id`, `transaction_id`)
- **Template Handling**: Improved template conditional logic for properly evaluating performance metric access
- **Patching Mechanism**: Refactored the patch mechanism for `MetricType.get_system_metric` to handle class method arguments correctly

See the [Changelog](Documentation/CHANGELOG.md) for complete details of recent fixes.

## Development Approach

EqTrak uses a fixture-based approach for configuration:
- Schema changes in migrations
- Configuration data in JSON fixtures
- Automatic loading at application startup

This approach keeps migrations clean and makes configuration changes easier to manage.
